No Special directions needed to be build the app.

Images are stored at location Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES for each device. The app does create thumbnails on the fly to display.
Audio is stored at device root storage.
For location I query the last known location.
For permission I have implemented the runtime request permission.
The app only supports portrait mode.
As the assignment suggests to use the custom view I have used canvas in image view itself to support on screen editing.
